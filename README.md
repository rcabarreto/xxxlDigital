# XXXLDigital Coding Challenge

Thanks for the opportunity of working on this assignment. Here you'll find some information on the project as well as ideas on how to improve it if more time was available.

## The Solution

The project consists of a single page application that shows a list of products. The application loads the data from the server and displays it according to search parameters and filters.

### The Stack

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

This project also includes:

- 🔐 **TypeScript** — For Type checking
- 💅 **Bootstrap** — Styles
- 🧭 **React Router** — For routing
- 💖 **ESlint** — For linting

I also created a small Backend application using Node and Express to serve data to the Client application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

and afterwards, run one of the commands below.

### `yarn start`

Runs both the backend and frontend apps in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn start:api`

Runs just the node backend.

### `yarn start:app`

Runs just the React Frontend application

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

# List of ideas to improve the project

### Backend:

- Separate the repos.
- Use a relational database like MySQL to store the data.
- Translate to TypeScript
- Add Authentication

### Frontend:

- Do more tests.
- Check the components for performance improvements.
